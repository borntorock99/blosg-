THE BLOCKCHAIN

The technology likely to have greatest impact on the next few decades have arrived
Its not the social media, not big data, its not robotics,its not even "AI".
YOU WILL BE surprised to learn that it is an underline technology of digital currency like"bitcoin" called blockchain


So blockchain-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
"ITS AN CONTINOUS UPDATED RECORD OF WHO HOLDS WHAT"

After 2008 financial crash "a misterious whiite paper emerged from the unknown entity
													
"a person named SATOSHI NAKAMOTO" released a paper, in this paper he disscused  about new decentralized pear to pear system its called the blockchain



So could it replace the internet --??
Let me break it down     --our current internet 
Is internet of information its based on the concept of copying and distributing information be it video /email or data we are just veiwing a copy of it 
For example while watching a youtube video you are just watching a copy of data uploaded on the internet .

The problem in the current internet is we dont have the copy of some data like money /bonds /cars /assets  /votes. Etc .

So what we will do in this case?? How can we access them 
And the solution was of using distributed lisure 
For example you are sending 500 rupees and then this 500 rupees will be updated to the blockchain so that every body will know that a block has been transferred


Now for the first time we can make a new stage of  internet on real value .


Its look like a fantasy becomming to be  true .?



So where else we can use the block chain

Its DISCRIBED IN THE  FITS MODEL 
So its an acronynm
Which means we can use the blockchain in the area
 where possiblity of fraud
intermedieries(middle man)
Throughput (no.of transaction per second)
And stable data


So where are block chain used today
-slides---land registries, diamond tracking using blockchain,nasdaq will soon be using block chain implication the bank of england and bank


Microsoft is embracing blockchain with its new ethereum based framework 
On the social maedia front -stemmit is the commpetitor of reddit ,and the most famous youtube competitor d-tube both are block chain based firms and user get paid in crptocurrency

Its even goes further when we talk about DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANISATION (DAO)
WITH DAO and blockchain technology  we have the capability to create huge company organisation that is distributed and automated for the first time in history.
DAO IS A DEMOCRATIC  COMPANY  THAT AUTOMATICALLY RUN

WITH THIS METHOD COMPANY LIKE AIRBNB ,CAR RENTING ,YOUTUBE CAN RUN AUTOMATICALLY.

One more example of it is in smart contract.

So how would a smart contract world look like?
So say in the future you are going to buy used mercedes benz ,traditionally you will go to dealer, you make sure the detail and history of the car correct,and done the bargain with seller, and send a money in bank and singn a lot of paper work, wait for the  money to clear and then you got your car 
This all process will take upto 15 days to all clear .
Now with the blockchain using a smart contract you can done all the orders in real time.

The car would be uploaded to the blockchain--so would already know that the details are correqct because its a trust built into the system you could buy this car by using cryptocurrency that is attached to your bank account and all of the ownership and detail are executed on the smart contract so everthing will be done in the matter of minutes instead of days your ownership will be attached  to your digital identity  in the blockchain and then all the record are updated so evry body knows that it is sold to you
